        "body": "To start at the beginning, the story of Craig & Josi starts on the dance floors of a Berlin nightclub. It's a classic story really: our eyes met, sparks flew, and life finally really began for our two lucky hearts. The music carried us long into the night, and the magic has carried us into the adventure-filled years that followed. Some couples start slow, and some take off like a rocket - we found ourselves in the latter group, and we continue to enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>It’s safe to say we’ve spent our 6 years together living life to the absolute fullest. We’ve traveled the world together and made friends from all corners of the globe. We’ve watched and supported as we’ve grown both personally and professionally. We’ve challenged ourselves to accomplish our goals both individually and as partners. And if one thing is absolutely certain, we’ve made sure to always have fun together along the way!<br/><br/>Out of all of our adventures together, our trip to Crete in 2020 stands out as one of the most romantic and impactful experiences we’ve shared. We always said how much we would love to get married in such a beautiful setting, and now we’re so excited to be able to make that dream come true. We couldn’t be happier to invite you to join us so we can bring together the people we love to celebrate with us.<br/><br/>There’s no comfort in the world like knowing that the person sitting next to you in life is looking out at the same horizon. When we gaze at our life together, this wedding represents the start of the main act of this story, and if the prologue has been any indication, it’s going to be an incredibly beautiful and Crasi life. ♡"

Note that there is no Uber on Crete, but plenty of taxi services available.<br/><br/>For the wedding ceremony, there will be shuttles to transport guests from their accommodation to the venue and back. There are many car rental companies with competitive rates in Crete, and the local small businesses tend to be quite friendly and reliable. Using a travel site like Kayak, Booking.com, or Expedia is probably the easiest way to search, but a classic Google also will also yield many results."

For the ladies, heels are of course welcome but stilettos are not recommended as the ceremony will take place in the middle of an olive grove without paved surfaces."
