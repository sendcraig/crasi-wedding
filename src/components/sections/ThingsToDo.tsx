The west side of the island is home to many fantastic beaches, the best and most famous of which are Balos and Elafonissi, but Falasarna, Marathi, and Loutraki beaches are also popular.<br/><br/>For the more adventurous, there is hiking in the southern and more mountainous parts of the island. The Kourtaliotiko Gorge in particular is known to be one of the most beautiful natural areas of the entire island, and is a little more than an hour drive from Chania.',

There are walking tours for those interested in learning more about the city.<br/><br/>The towns and villages near Chania are also full of charm, such as Kalyves, Almyrida, Vamos, and Gavalochori to the east, and Kissamos, Elos, and Kaliviani to the west.',

We also recommend travelling to nearby villages to visit an authentic taverna in the countryside and enjoy some Raki with your meal and the famous Cretan hospitality.
